# automata graphviz
Automata Graphing tool using Python and Graphviz

Please excuse the spaghetti code.

Supports:
- Graphing
  - Non Deterministic Finite Automata (NDFA)
  - Pushdown Automata (PDA)
  - Turing Machine 
- Logic Simulator in console (Incomplete)
  - NDFA (Not implemented)
  - PDA (Needs more testing for edge cases)
  - TM (Initial efforts made to simulate the logic)
  
 
## How it works:

1. It will ask for the Quintuple or Septuple depending on the automata you wish to graph.
2. It will finally ask for the transitions with the format specified.
3. A pdf file is created with the information already provided. 


Feel free to use this code as you please. WTFPL
